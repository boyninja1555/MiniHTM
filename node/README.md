# MiniHTM for JavaScript/TypeScript

MiniHTM (Minimal Hyper-Text Markup) is a multi-language library meant to craft minimal HTML from basic function/method calls. Unlike most "libraries", you call our functions/methods. MiniHTM acts as a library, not a framework. This specific directory is the JavaScript/TypeScript port, which is written in TypeScript, and compiled to JavaScript for usage. All versions come with full type support.

If you are looking for another supported language, see [this list](https://github.com/boyninja1555/MiniHTM/blob/main/README.md).
