# MiniHTM Official Repository

MiniHTM (Minimal Hyper-Text Markup) is a multi-language library meant to craft minimal HTML from basic function/method calls. Unlike most "libraries", you call our functions/methods. MiniHTM acts as a library, not a framework. Below are the supported languages, and their reason(s) for having MiniHTM support.

[**JavaScript/TypeScript:**](./node/README.md) Other "libraries" for this language are either not libraries, or run on the client-side. However, MiniHTM is not meant to compete, and runs when you tell it to.
